Descriptive Statistics
===============

Overview
--------

 This gem adds methods to the Enumerable module to allow easy calculation of basic descriptive statistics.

Examples
--------

```
> require 'descriptive_statistics'
 => true 
> data = [2,6,9,3,5,1,8,3,6,9,2]
 => [2, 6, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 2] 
> data.number
 => 11.0 
> data.sum
 => 54 
> data.mean
 => 4.909090909090909 
> data.median
 => 5.0 
> data.variance
 => 7.7190082644628095 
> data.standard_deviation
 => 2.778310325442932 
> data.percentile(70)
 => 6.0 
> data.percentile(70)
 => 6.0 
> [4,2,3,1,4,5,6,8,0].mode
 => 4
> [17, 5, 3, 23, 33, 30, 45, 37].range
 => 42
```

Alternatively, you can use `DescriptiveStatistics` on individual 
objects, avoiding a global monkey patch.

```
> require 'descriptive_statistics/safe'
 => true
> data = [2,6,9,3,5,1,8,3,6,9,2]
 => [2, 6, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 2] 
> data.extend(DescriptiveStatistics)
 => [2, 6, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 2] 
> data.number
 => 11.0 
> data.sum
 => 54 
```
